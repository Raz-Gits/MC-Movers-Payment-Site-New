Summary of dispute settlement program: The neutral arbitration program has been designed to give neither party any special advantage. If a dispute arises between MC Movers LLC and the shipper arbitration may be a mutually beneficial alternative to help resolve the dispute. Section 49 CFR Section 375.211 provides that a mover must have a program in place to provide shippers with an Arbitration alternative. Arbitration is optional and not required under Federal law. A. Summary of the arbitration process: Arbitration is an alternative to courtroom litigation. It provides each party to the dispute to present their cases and allows a neutral third party arbitrator to make decision as to the merits of each side\\`s case. Arbitration subject to this agreement shall be conducted via written submission and, subject to the arbitrator\\`s discretion, through telephonic appearance. After the initial filing fees have been paid and the arbitrator selected, the initiating party or \"Claimant\" must submit a written brief summarizing their legal position and factual claims. All supporting documentation must be included with the initial arbitration brief. Copies of all documents must be submitted to all parties involved in the arbitration. Upon receipt of the Claimant\\`s arbitration brief and supporting documents, the responding party or \"Respondent\" will have 30 days to file their responsive arbitration brief and supporting documentation. Further deadlines and timetables are subject to the arbitrator\\`s discretion. B. Legal effects: If the arbitration alternative is chosen, then any decision made by the arbitrator may be binding. Additionally, an arbitration decision may not be appealed in a court of law. All parties agree that the Arbitrators decision will be based exclusively on the governing United States Federal Law without regard to conflicting State laws or regulations. C. Applicable costs: Each party is responsible for their own costs associated with arbitration. A benefit to the arbitration alternative may be that it is less expensive than traditional litigation. Each party is responsible for 50% of the costs associated with securing the arbitrator and 100% of their own expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees. There is a $250 filing fee FOR EACH PARTY and a supplemental charge of $50 administration fee.

Option 1: Replacement: Under this option, the mover is liable for the replacement value of lost or damaged goods (as long as it doesn't exceed the total declared value of the shipment). If you elect to purchase full value protection, and your mover loses, damages or destroys your articles, your mover must repair, replace with like items, or settle in cash at the current market replacement value, regardless of the age of the lost or damaged item. The amount of the deductible will affect the cost of your FVP coverage. Unless you specifically agree to other arrangements, the mover must assume liability for the entire shipment based upon this option. Option 2 (FREE): Limited Liability: As a licensed carrier with the U.S. D.O.T. we are required to provide limited liability coverage at no charge to the customer. Under this option, the maximum liability is limited to $0.60 per pound per article, for all items indicated as damaged or missing at time of delivery on the inventory logs. Failure to indicate damage at time of delivery will waive carrier\\`s liability. Under both of these liability options, movers are permitted to limit their liability for loss or damage to articles of extraordinary value, unless you specifically list these articles on the shipping documents. An article of extraordinary value is any item whose value exceeds $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram). Valuation of claims will be based on the AMSA Joint Military/Industry Table of weights and depreciation guide.\n\nSECTION 5: Maximum period of time to file a claim or bring civil action: Shipper has a maximum period of nine months to from the date of delivery to file a claim for loss or damages.

Additionally, mechanical vehicles including but not limited to automobiles, motorcycles, scooters, boats, airplanes, atvs, go-carts, riding lawnmowers, tractors, and other similar vehicles are transported at the sole risk of the shipper since all coverage for those items is waived against the carrier, its agents or representatives.

Summary of dispute settlement program: The neutral arbitration program has been designed to give neither party any special advantage. If a dispute arises between MC Movers LLC and the shipper arbitration may be a mutually beneficial alternative to help resolve the dispute. Section 49 CFR Section 375.211 provides that a mover must have a program in place to provide shippers with an Arbitration alternative. Arbitration is optional and not required under Federal law. A. Summary of the arbitration process: Arbitration is an alternative to courtroom litigation. It provides each party to the dispute to present their cases and allows a neutral third party arbitrator to make decision as to the merits of each side\\`s case. Arbitration subject to this agreement shall be conducted via written submission and, subject to the arbitrator\\`s discretion, through telephonic appearance. After the initial filing fees have been paid and the arbitrator selected, the initiating party or \"Claimant\" must submit a written brief summarizing their legal position and factual claims. All supporting documentation must be included with the initial arbitration brief. Copies of all documents must be submitted to all parties involved in the arbitration. Upon receipt of the Claimant\\`s arbitration brief and supporting documents, the responding party or \"Respondent\" will have 30 days to file their responsive arbitration brief and supporting documentation. Further deadlines and timetables are subject to the arbitrator\\`s discretion. B. Legal effects: If the arbitration alternative is chosen, then any decision made by the arbitrator may be binding. Additionally, an arbitration decision may not be appealed in a court of law. All parties agree that the Arbitrators decision will be based exclusively on the governing United States Federal Law without regard to conflicting State laws or regulations. C. Applicable costs: Each party is responsible for their own costs associated with arbitration. A benefit to the arbitration alternative may be that it is less expensive than traditional litigation. Each party is responsible for 50% of the costs associated with securing the arbitrator and 100% of their own expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees. There is a $250 filing fee FOR EACH PARTY and a supplemental charge of $50 administration fee.

Option 1: Replacement: Under this option, the mover is liable for the replacement value of lost or damaged goods (as long as it doesn't exceed the total declared value of the shipment). If you elect to purchase full value protection, and your mover loses, damages or destroys your articles, your mover must repair, replace with like items, or settle in cash at the current market replacement value, regardless of the age of the lost or damaged item. The amount of the deductible will affect the cost of your FVP coverage. Unless you specifically agree to other arrangements, the mover must assume liability for the entire shipment based upon this option. Option 2 (FREE): Limited Liability: As a licensed carrier with the U.S. D.O.T. we are required to provide limited liability coverage at no charge to the customer. Under this option, the maximum liability is limited to $0.60 per pound per article, for all items indicated as damaged or missing at time of delivery on the inventory logs. Failure to indicate damage at time of delivery will waive carrier\\`s liability. Under both of these liability options, movers are permitted to limit their liability for loss or damage to articles of extraordinary value, unless you specifically list these articles on the shipping documents. An article of extraordinary value is any item whose value exceeds $100 per pound ($220 per kilogram).

Additionally, unless you purchased an \"exclusive use of the vehicle\" option, there is no guarantee that your items will not be temporarily stored or offloaded and reloaded onto a different vehicle then performed pickup and consolidated with other shipments.\n\nSECTION 20: Inspection of Carrier\\`s Tariff: Governing tariff is available for inspection upon reasonable request by calling MC Movers LLC.`\n    }\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Header />\n      <Navigation />\n      <main className=\"main-content\">\n        <HeroSection />\n      </main>\n      {paymentMethods.map((method) => (\n        <PaymentSection\n          key={method.id}\n          id={method.id}\n          title={method.title}\n          icon={method.icon}\n          description={method.description}\n          features={method.features}\n          instructions={method.instructions}\n          section1Preview={method.section1Preview}\n        />\n      ))}\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,WAAW;AAClB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,qBAAqB;AACxC,OAAOC,UAAU,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAChD,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,0BAA0B;AAClD,OAAOC,cAAc,MAAM,6BAA6B;AACxD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,qBAAqB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzC,SAASC,GAAGA,CAAA,EAAG;EACb,MAAMC,cAAc,GAAG,CACrB;IACEC,EAAE,EAAE,OAAO;IACXC,KAAK,EAAE,eAAe;IACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,8CAA8C;IAC3DC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,QAAQ,EAAE,oBAAoB,EAAE,iBAAiB,CAAC;IAC7DC,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEL,EAAE,EAAE,OAAO;IACXC,KAAK,EAAE,eAAe;IACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,4CAA4C;IACzDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAE,SAAS,EAAE,qBAAqB,CAAC;IAChEC,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEL,EAAE,EAAE,OAAO;IACXC,KAAK,EAAE,eAAe;IACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,gDAAgD;IAC7DC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,YAAY,EAAE,eAAe,EAAE,qBAAqB,CAAC;IAChEC,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEL,EAAE,EAAE,YAAY;IAChBC,KAAK,EAAE,6BAA6B;IACpCC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,4CAA4C;IACzDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,mBAAmB,EAAE,mBAAmB,EAAE,iBAAiB,CAAC;IACvEC,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEL,EAAE,EAAE,MAAM;IACVC,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;IAChCC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,2BAA2B;IACxCC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,cAAc,EAAE,eAAe,EAAE,uBAAuB,CAAC;IACpEC,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEL,EAAE,EAAE,OAAO;IACXC,KAAK,EAAE,sBAAsB;IAC7BC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,WAAW,EAAE,kCAAkC;IAC/CC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,kBAAkB,EAAE,aAAa,EAAE,gBAAgB,CAAC;IAC/DE,eAAe,EAAE,uhHAAuhH;IACxiHD,YAAY,EAAE;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,CACF;EAED,oBACER,OAAA;IAAKU,SAAS,EAAC,KAAK;IAAAC,QAAA,gBAClBX,OAAA,CAACN,MAAM;MAAAkB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACVf,OAAA,CAACL,UAAU;MAAAiB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACdf,OAAA;MAAMU,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;MAAAC,QAAA,eAC5BX,OAAA,CAACJ,WAAW;QAAAgB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACX,CAAC,EACNb,cAAc,CAACc,GAAG,CAAEC,MAAM,iBACzBjB,OAAA,CAACH,cAAc;MAEbM,EAAE,EAAEc,MAAM,CAACd,EAAG;MACdC,KAAK,EAAEa,MAAM,CAACb,KAAM;MACpBC,IAAI,EAAEY,MAAM,CAACZ,IAAK;MAClBC,WAAW,EAAEW,MAAM,CAACX,WAAY;MAChCC,QAAQ,EAAEU,MAAM,CAACV,QAAS;MAC1BC,YAAY,EAAES,MAAM,CAACT,YAAa;MAClCC,eAAe,EAAEQ,MAAM,CAACR;IAAgB,GAPnCQ,MAAM,CAACd,EAAE;MAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAQf,CACF,CAAC,eACFf,OAAA,CAACF,MAAM;MAAAc,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAE,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACP,CAAC;AAEV;AAACG,EAAA,GApKQjB,GAAG;AAsKZ,eAAeA,GAAG;AAAC,IAAAiB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
